# PDR-005: Tiered Value Proposition (Free→Pro→Enterprise)

- **Status**: Proposed
- **Data**: 2025-08-29
- **Autor**: Product Decision Architect

## Contexto

ValidaHub está evoluindo para plataforma de inteligência, necessitando modelo de pricing que capture valor crescente desde validação básica até insights estratégicos. Current pricing volume-based não reflete valor diferenciado de intelligence features.

Análise do mercado:
- **Freemium competitors**: Oferecem validação básica gratuita, monetizam features avançadas
- **Enterprise needs**: Querem benchmarking, compliance, integração, SLA
- **SME price sensitivity**: Dispostos a pagar por value claro, não por volume
- **Network effects**: Mais usuários = benchmarks mais precisos = mais valor

## Alternativas Consideradas

### Opção A: Volume-Only Pricing (status quo)
- **Prós**: Simples, cresce com usage
- **Contras**: Não captura valor de intelligence, penaliza growth

### Opção B: Feature-Based Pricing
- **Prós**: Pay-for-what-you-use
- **Contras**: Confusing, dificulta upsell

### Opção C: Value-Tiered Freemium (escolhido)
- **Prós**: Acquisition + retention + expansion revenue
- **Contras**: Complex pricing page, may devalue core features

## Rationale / Trade-offs

**Por que Value-Tiered:**
- **Acquisition**: Free tier removes friction, drives trial
- **Expansion**: Clear upgrade path baseado em value, não complexity  
- **Retention**: Each tier solves specific job-to-be-done
- **Revenue diversification**: Recurring subscription revenue vs usage spikes

**Tier Logic:**
- **Free**: Solves immediate problem (broken CSV) to prove value
- **Pro**: Adds competitive context (benchmarking) for growth-stage
- **Enterprise**: Strategic intelligence for decision-making at scale

**Trade-offs aceitos:**
- Free tier may cannibalize some paid usage
- Complexity em pricing page and feature management
- Revenue predictability vs pure usage-based

## Scope & Boundaries

**In-scope:**
- 3-tier freemium model com clear differentiation
- Usage limits no Free, unlimited no Pro/Enterprise
- Intelligence features as primary differentiation Pro+
- Enterprise SLA and compliance features

**Out-of-scope:**
- Usage-based pricing dentro dos tiers (unlimited Pro+)
- Industry-specific tiers (retail vs distributor)
- Geographic pricing variations
- Custom enterprise tiers below $299/month

## Consequências

### Positivo
- **Lower barrier to entry**: Free tier drives trial and adoption
- **Clear upgrade path**: Each tier solves next-level problem
- **Revenue expansion**: Intelligence features command premium
- **Competitive differentiation**: Intelligence > utility positioning
- **Predictable revenue**: Monthly subscriptions vs usage fluctuations

### Negativo
- **Free tier cost**: Support and infrastructure for non-paying users
- **Feature complexity**: Managing feature flags across tiers
- **Pricing page confusion**: More complex than simple usage-based
- **Cannibalization risk**: Some current paid users may downgrade to Free

### Neutro
- **Customer segmentation**: Natural segmentation by company stage/size
- **Support burden**: Different support levels require processes
