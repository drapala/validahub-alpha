# ValidaHub Value Objects Test Improvement Checklist

## Overview
This checklist addresses critical design issues, domain rule gaps, and quality improvements identified in the ValidaHub value objects testing suite. The issues are prioritized to fix the most critical problems first while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring robust domain validation.

---

## P0 - Critical Design Issues (Must Fix Immediately)

### TenantId Pattern Mismatch
- [ ] **Fix TenantId test expectations vs implementation**
  - Current tests expect simple normalization (lowercase, strip whitespace)
  - Actual implementation requires strict `t_[alphanumeric]+` pattern
  - **Action**: Update all TenantId tests to use valid pattern format (e.g., "t_123" instead of "tenant_123")
  - **Files**: `tests/unit/domain/test_value_objects.py` lines 13-88

### IdempotencyKey Length Validation Gap
- [ ] **Fix IdempotencyKey minimum length mismatch**
  - Tests expect 8-character minimum, implementation requires 16-character minimum
  - Current test `test_accepts_minimum_length()` will always fail
  - **Action**: Update test expectations to match 16-128 character requirement
  - **Files**: `tests/unit/domain/test_value_objects.py` lines 99-102, 115-118

### IdempotencyKey Character Set Validation Gap  
- [ ] **Fix IdempotencyKey allowed characters mismatch**
  - Tests allow dots and colons (`.:`), implementation pattern only allows `[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]`
  - Multiple tests will fail due to this discrepancy
  - **Action**: Remove dots and colons from test character sets
  - **Files**: `tests/unit/domain/test_value_objects.py` lines 112-113, 177-179

## P1 - Domain Rule Gaps (Should Fix Soon)

### Missing Value Object Coverage
- [ ] **Add comprehensive tests for JobId**
  - Test UUID v4 validation
  - Test generation method
  - Test from_string parsing with invalid formats
  - Test immutability and equality

- [ ] **Add comprehensive tests for SellerId**
  - Test pattern validation `^[a-zA-Z0-9][a-zA-Z0-9_\-]{0,98}[a-zA-Z0-9]$|^[a-zA-Z0-9]$`
  - Test edge cases: single character, maximum length (100), boundary characters
  - Test invalid formats: starting/ending with special chars

- [ ] **Add comprehensive tests for Channel**
  - Test pattern validation for lowercase alphanumeric with underscores
  - Test `is_known()` method with KNOWN_CHANNELS
  - Test case normalization
  - Test boundary cases: single char, maximum length (50)

- [ ] **Add comprehensive tests for FileReference**
  - Test URL pattern validation
  - Test `get_bucket()` and `get_key()` extraction methods
  - Test various URL formats (s3://, https://, relative paths)
  - Test length boundaries (3-1024 characters)

- [ ] **Add comprehensive tests for JobType**
  - Test all VALID_TYPES constants
  - Test case normalization
  - Test invalid job types rejection
  - Test class constants accessibility

- [ ] **Add comprehensive tests for RulesProfileId**
  - Test SemVer pattern validation including pre-release and build metadata
  - Test `from_string()` parsing with various formats
  - Test invalid formats (missing @, multiple @, invalid version)

### Business Logic Validation Gaps
- [ ] **Add ProcessingCounters business rule validation**
  - Test that `errors + warnings â‰¤ processed` (currently missing)
  - Test edge case where `processed = total` but `errors + warnings > processed`
  - Test `warnings` count validation (should not exceed `processed`)

- [ ] **Add cross-field validation tests**
  - Test ProcessingCounters with `warnings > processed - errors`
  - Test RulesProfileId where channel doesn't match Channel value object rules

### Security and Edge Case Testing
- [ ] **Add TenantId security tests**
  - Test injection attempts in tenant ID format
  - Test Unicode normalization attacks
  - Test extremely long inputs before validation
  - Test null byte injection

- [ ] **Add IdempotencyKey collision resistance tests**
  - Test that generated keys have sufficient entropy
  - Test that sequential generation produces unique values
  - Test edge cases with special characters at boundaries

## P2 - Quality Improvements (Nice to Have)

### Property-Based Testing Enhancements
- [ ] **Improve Hypothesis test coverage**
  - Add property tests for all missing value objects

  - Test value object creation performance with large inputs
  - Test hash consistency performance for dict/set usage
  - Test memory usage for immutable objects

### Test Structure and Maintainability  
- [ ] **Standardize test class organization**
  - Consistent naming: `TestValueObjectName` for each VO
  - Group tests by: creation, validation, business rules, edge cases
  - Add comprehensive docstrings for each test method

- [ ] **Add parameterized test matrices**
  - Create test matrices for boundary conditions
  - Use `@pytest.mark.parametrize` for systematic edge case coverage
  - Add negative test matrices for all validation failures

- [ ] **Improve test data organization**
  - Move test fixtures to `conftest.py` for reuse
  - Create factory methods for valid/invalid test data
  - Add builder pattern for complex value object creation

### Integration and Contract Testing
- [ ] **Add value object serialization tests**
  - Test JSON serialization/deserialization roundtrip
  - Test compatibility with Pydantic models
  - Test database persistence and retrieval

- [ ] **Add cross-value-object relationship tests**
  - Test JobId + TenantId + SellerId combinations
  - Test RulesProfileId + Channel consistency
  - Test FileReference + JobId association patterns

## Notes
- Fix P0 issues immediately to unblock development
- P1 issues should be addressed before production deployment
- P2 improvements can be done incrementally
- Consider adding golden tests for value object serialization formats
- Monitor test execution time as coverage increases
- Document any exceptions or intentional gaps in coverage
