   - Mitigation: Real-time consent validation, processing halt mechanisms
3. **Cross-Border Data Transfer**: Risk of LGPD violation
   - Mitigation: Geographic data restrictions, transfer documentation

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **Performance Impact**: Privacy controls may affect system performance
   - Mitigation: Performance testing, optimization during implementation
2. **User Experience**: Complex privacy interfaces may reduce usability
   - Mitigation: UX testing, progressive disclosure design

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 95% test coverage for privacy features
- **Legal Review**: All implementations validated by legal counsel
- **Phased Rollout**: Gradual deployment with monitoring and rollback capability
- **Training Program**: Team education on LGPD requirements and implementation
